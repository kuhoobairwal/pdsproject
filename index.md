# Introduction

This project explores the venture capital (VC) fundraising landscape using a dataset of over **3,800 individual funds**. The data includes detailed information on each fund's characteristics‚Äîsuch as its age, investment stage, country focus, associated firm size, and more.

### The Central Question:
> **Can we predict how much capital a VC fund will raise based on its fund structure, firm characteristics, and strategic focus?**

Understanding which factors drive fundraising success is crucial for investors, founders, and policy-makers alike. Venture capital shapes the flow of innovation and access to opportunity‚Äîyet the fundraising process often seems opaque. This project aims to shed light on the patterns behind successful capital raises, using data-driven modeling to reveal which characteristics actually matter.

This analysis is particularly relevant to **limited partners (LPs)**‚Äîsuch as institutional investors, endowments, and high-net-worth individuals‚Äîwho allocate capital across multiple venture firms. By examining how fund-level characteristics relate to fundraising outcomes, LPs can better assess a firm's track record and compare it against industry-wide patterns. This model may support more informed decision-making when evaluating which VC firms demonstrate consistent fundraising success.


## Dataset Overview

- **Total number of observations (rows):** 3,856 funds  [] todo
- **Source:** Compiled from VC and private equity databases  
- **Time span:** Fund launches from the 2000s to present  
- **Focus:** Fund-level data, not startup-level data


## Relevant Columns for Prediction

| Column Name              | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `Fund Amount Raised`     | **Target variable** ‚Äî total capital raised by the fund (in millions) |
| `AUM (Current)`          | Assets under management for the firm managing the fund |
| `Fund Age`               | Age of the fund (in years) |
| `Firm # of Funds`        | Number of total funds the firm has launched |
| `Average Fund Size (MM)` | Current average fund size at the firm |
| `Fund Type`              | Investment stage focus (e.g., Early Stage, Buyout, Mixed) ‚Äî multi-label |
| `Fund Country Focus`     | Geographic target of investments (e.g., US, Europe) |
| `Fund Status`            | Whether the fund is currently raising, inevesting or closed |
| `Fund Industry Focus`    | Industry sectors the fund invests in (e.g., healthcare, tech) ‚Äî multi-label |

These columns were selected based on their potential predictive value and their availability **prior to fundraising**, to avoid data leakage.


# Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

## Data Cleaning Steps

The raw dataset initially contained data on over **6,000 venture capital funds**, which required substantial cleaning and transformation to ensure consistency and usability. Key steps included handling missing values, standardizing existing features, and creating derived variables from timestamps.

- The original dataset included a `Fund Open Date` column, which was used to create a new variable: `Fund Age`. This feature calculates the number of years a fund has been active, allowing for a more interpretable and relevant metric when evaluating a fund's track record.

- The dataset also contained a column called `Fund Invests in Multiple Rounds`, referring to cases where a VC fund reinvests in startups it has already funded. This can be a strategic move to protect equity or support growth. However, this column had over **5,200 missing values out of 6,200**, making it too incomplete to be useful. As a result, it was dropped from the final dataset.

- I conducted initial visual analysis to understand the distribution of numerical variables. This revealed that several columns, including `AUM (Current)`, were **highly skewed** and contained significant outliers. Below are plots showing the boxplot and distribution of `AUM (Current)` before cleaning:

  <img src="AUM-distribution.png" alt="AUM Chart 2" width="600"/>
</p>

- To address these extreme outliers, I applied **IQR-based filtering** instead of the more common 3-standard-deviation rule. Because the AUM distribution was **right-skewed**, the mean and standard deviation were distorted by a few extremely large values. The IQR method uses the interquartile range to identify and filter out outliers more robustly. This resulted in a distribution that better reflects the **central tendency** of most funds.

</p>

- After these cleaning steps, the total number of observations was reduced to **4,820**, resulting in a cleaner and more reliable dataset for modeling and analysis.

## Insights from Exploratory Data Analysis

Visual analysis of the dataset provided several key insights into the structure and characteristics of venture capital funds.

### üåç Fund Country Focus

Most funds in the dataset are based in the **United States** (2,377), followed by **India** with 213 funds. This trend aligns with expectations, as the U.S. has long been the epicenter of venture capital activity‚Äîparticularly in regions like Silicon Valley and San Francisco.

### üöÄ Fund Type (Stage Focus)

The majority of funds in the dataset are focused on **Early Stage** investments. Some funds invest across multiple stages (e.g., Seed + Early + Late), but **Late Stage-only funds are relatively rare**. This reflects real-world dynamics: as investment rounds progress, the required check sizes grow substantially‚Äîoften into the hundreds of millions or billions‚Äîmaking later-stage investing accessible to fewer firms.

### üìà AUM vs. Number of Funds (Colored by Fund Age)

This scatter plot explores the relationship between the number of funds managed by a firm and its current assets under management (AUM). Each point represents a fund and is color-coded by its age.

<p align="center">
  <img src="aum_vs_funds_scatter.png" alt="Scatter plot of AUM vs Number of Funds with Fund Age coloring">
</p>

There is a **slightly positive trend**: as the number of funds managed increases, AUM tends to rise as well. However, the relationship is **weak and noisy**, with wide variation in AUM even among firms managing the same number of funds.

Color gradients suggest that **fund age is not a strong determinant of AUM**. Older funds appear throughout the AUM spectrum, indicating that factors like investment strategy, fund type, or firm reputation may be more influential than time alone.


### Grouped Table: Fund Type vs. Average AUM

This grouped table highlights the **average assets under management (AUM)** for funds operating at different investment stages. Funds that span **multiple stages**‚Äîespecially those combining early stage, later stage, and buyout strategies‚Äîtend to manage significantly higher capital.

This suggests that **broad-stage or hybrid investment approaches** are associated with larger fund sizes. Rather than specializing solely in early or late stage, many of the highest-AUM fund types include a blend of strategies, which may signal greater flexibility, experience, or appeal to institutional investors.

| Fund Type                                           | Average AUM (in Millions) |
|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------:|
| Early Stage; Fund of Funds; Secondary; Buyout      | 3,167.71                   |
| Seed Stage; Early Stage; Later Stage; Secondary... | 2,102.77                   |
| Seed Stage; Early Stage; Later Stage; Fund of Funds| 1,787.27                   |
| Early Stage; Later Stage; LBO; MBO; Buyout         | 1,777.40                   |
| Early Stage; Real Estate                           | 1,764.08                   |
| ...                                                | ...                        |
| Early Stage; Mezzanine; Debt                       | 28.42                      |
| Early Stage; Secondary                             | 18.03                      |
| Seed Stage; Early Stage; Fund of Funds             | 11.46                      |
| Mezzanine; LBO; Real Estate                        | 11.43                      |
| Seed Stage; Early Stage; Infrastructure/Proj Fin   | 4.81                       |

This breakdown supports the broader finding that **larger funds often diversify across multiple stages**, likely due to the increased capital demands and longer investment horizons involved in managing a more flexible portfolio.


### Imputation

For this project, I made selective decisions about how to handle missing data, balancing data quality with time constraints and model interpretability.

A notable variable, `Fund Industry Focus`, was **excluded from modeling** due to several challenges:
- It had **multi-label values** (e.g., "Healthcare; Fintech; Consumer"), requiring multi-hot encoding
- It showed **extremely high cardinality** with hundreds of unique industry combinations
- Fewer than **1,000 out of 4,800 rows** had non-missing values, making imputation unreliable
- Creating a catch-all `'Other'` category resulted in too many rows falling into this group
- Feature engineering for this column would have required extensive parsing, cleaning, and transformation that wasn't feasible within the project's time constraints

As a result, I opted to **drop `Fund Industry Focus` entirely** from the modeling dataset, instead of doing imputation. This decision was supported by the fact that most of the dataset (~80%) was missing industry data anyway, meaning the exclusion would not significantly affect model performance.

# Framing a Prediction Problem

We posed the following question:  
**Can we predict how much capital a fund will raise based on its characteristics (industry, type, region, etc.)?**

We treated this as a **regression problem**, where the target variable is `Fund Amount Raised`, and predictors include:

- Fund Type
- Number of Funds per Firm
- Industry Focus
- Region
- Gender/Impact Focus

# Baseline Model

Our baseline model was a simple **mean predictor**, where every fund was assumed to raise the same amount ‚Äî the overall average. This allowed us to benchmark performance.

### Baseline RMSE:
`$XX.XX million`  
*(Fill this in with your value)*

# Final Model

Our final model used a **Random Forest Regressor** trained on engineered features such as log-transformed fund size and encoded industry focus. We tuned hyperparameters using cross-validation and reduced overfitting through pruning and feature selection.

### Final RMSE:
`$XX.XX million`  
*(Add your model performance here)*

### Feature Importance:
- `Industry` and `Fund Type` had the strongest predictive power
- Gender-focused funds had slightly lower predicted outcomes, matching real-world disparities
