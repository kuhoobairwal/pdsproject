title: Venture Capital Funding Analysis

# Introduction



# Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

The raw dataset contained data for over 6000 funds, which was cleaned by handling missing values and standardizing existing ones. Key steps included:

- The inital datatset contained a 'Fund Open Date' column, which was used to create the newer 'Fund Age' column that stores the number of years that the VC fund has been active for. This transformation was done so that 'Fund Age' could directly  better analyse the performance of the VC fund. 
- The inital dataset contained a 'Fund Invests in Multiple Rounds' coumn, which refers to when a fund invests more money in a company that has already received funding from them. This can be a strategic move to increase their stake, protect their ownership, or support the growth of a promising startup. However, on further analysis of this column, it had missing data for 5200/6200 firms. Hence, for the lack of complete data, this this column was dropped from the final dataset.
- The initial dataset contained a 'Fund Status' column, which had 4 possible values, "Investing", "Divesting", "Raising" or "Liquidated". In fund management, investing means acquiring assets, divesting means selling existing assets, raising refers to acquiring new capital from investors and liquidating means shutting down the fund and selling all remaining assets. I created a numerical mapping for each of their 4 values for ease of analysis later in the project.

### Key Insights from EDA:
- Most funds are concentrated in the US and Europe.
- Women-focused funds manage more funds per firm but raise less capital on average.
- Industry focus is skewed towards healthcare, fintech, and consumer sectors.

# Framing a Prediction Problem

We posed the following question:  
**Can we predict how much capital a fund will raise based on its characteristics (industry, type, region, etc.)?**

We treated this as a **regression problem**, where the target variable is `Fund Amount Raised`, and predictors include:

- Fund Type
- Number of Funds per Firm
- Industry Focus
- Region
- Gender/Impact Focus

# Baseline Model

Our baseline model was a simple **mean predictor**, where every fund was assumed to raise the same amount â€” the overall average. This allowed us to benchmark performance.

### Baseline RMSE:
`$XX.XX million`  
*(Fill this in with your value)*

# Final Model

Our final model used a **Random Forest Regressor** trained on engineered features such as log-transformed fund size and encoded industry focus. We tuned hyperparameters using cross-validation and reduced overfitting through pruning and feature selection.

### Final RMSE:
`$XX.XX million`  
*(Add your model performance here)*

### Feature Importance:
- `Industry` and `Fund Type` had the strongest predictive power
- Gender-focused funds had slightly lower predicted outcomes, matching real-world disparities
